"""Vendored ``mtp_generate_step`` from mlx-lm PR #990 (commit ``50c164fb``).

The function is a near-verbatim port of upstream
``mlx_lm/generate.py::mtp_generate_step``. Three things had to change
to make it importable against our installed mlx-lm 0.31.3:

1. ``make_sampler_chain`` does not exist upstream — PR #990 adds it.
   We define a local fallback :func:`_make_sampler_chain` with the
   exact same signature. When upstream merges, callers can switch to
   ``mlx_lm.sample_utils.make_sampler_chain`` without any other
   change.
2. ``apply_xtc`` does not yet accept a ``p_draw`` argument upstream —
   PR #990 adds it for shared-draw determinism. We wrap upstream's
   ``apply_xtc`` and override the draw with the cell when the
   ``p_draw`` slot is set, falling back to a fresh draw otherwise.
3. The accept-rate counter (:class:`MTPAcceptCounter`) is rapid-mlx's
   addition. PR #990 just prints an accept ratio at the end; we
   instead bump
   :func:`vllm_mlx.spec_decode.mtp.accept_counter.get_global_counter`
   on every attempt / accept, which surfaces through the Prometheus
   ``rapid_mlx_spec_decode_*`` series.

Everything else — the verify / accept logic, the rollback path, the
probabilistic-acceptance ``min(1, p_target/p_draft)`` test, the
residual-distribution sample on rejection — is the upstream code
unchanged. That is intentional. The lossless contract (byte-identical
to non-spec-decode for the same prompt + seed at temp=0) lives in the
verify / accept arithmetic, and rewriting it would risk a divergence
that a unit test against a single mocked model can't catch.

Public signature mirrors upstream so callers can swap
``mtp_generate_step(prompt, model, ...)`` for
``mlx_lm.generate.generate_step(prompt, model, ...)`` with only kwarg
adjustments.

    Vendored verbatim from mlx-lm PR #990
    ``mlx_lm/generate.py::mtp_generate_step``. Each iteration runs one
    backbone forward pass (over the current token plus its pending
    draft) and one MTP forward pass (to propose the next draft). Up
    to two tokens are emitted per backbone step: one always-accepted
    backbone token and one conditionally-accepted draft token.

    Requirements on ``model``:

    * Implements ``mtp_forward(hidden, next_token_ids, mtp_cache)``
      returning logits of shape ``(B, N, vocab_size)``.
    * Implements ``make_mtp_cache()`` returning a list of caches the
      MTP transformer layers can write into.
    * Accepts ``return_hidden=True`` in ``__call__`` and returns
      ``(logits, hidden)`` where ``hidden`` is the pre-norm backbone
      hidden state at every position.
    * Accepts ``n_confirmed=int`` in ``__call__`` (used by the
      GatedDeltaNet layer to snapshot its SSM/conv state at the
      confirmed boundary so the generator can roll back on draft
      rejection).

    The :func:`vllm_mlx.spec_decode.mtp.qwen3_5_inject.inject_mtp_support`
    helper installs all four on a freshly-loaded
    ``mlx_lm.models.qwen3_5.TextModel`` instance.

    Yields:
        Tuples of ``(token_int, logprobs_array, from_draft_bool)``.
        ``from_draft`` is ``True`` when the token came from an
        accepted MTP draft, ``False`` when it came from the backbone.

    Args:
        accept_counter: Optional override for the process-global
            :class:`MTPAcceptCounter`. Tests pass a fresh counter to
            isolate measurements; production callers pass ``None``

        Two cascade shapes are supported, selected by the injected
        ``mtp_forward`` surface:

        1. **Drafter-hidden cascade (preferred)**. When ``mtp_forward``
           accepts ``return_hidden=True`` (Gemma 4 Google-assistant
           inject, ``0.9.13`` Fix 3), the drafter's own
           ``post_projection(h)`` is fed into the next iteration's
           ``hidden_last`` slot. This mirrors Google's
           ``Gemma4AssistantDraftModel.draft_block`` in
           ``mlx_vlm/speculative/drafters/gemma4_assistant/gemma4_assistant.py``:
           each successive iteration sees a fresh drafter-hidden
           context instead of reusing target's frozen hidden, and each
           successive iteration's token IS shaped by the prior
           iteration's own reasoning. This is what makes chain-of-K
           produce a NON-DEGENERATE chain on Google's assistant (where
           K/V is shared with target and does NOT advance across
           chain calls, so a target-hidden-frozen cascade would
           produce d_1 == d_2 == d_3 at temp=0).
        2. **Target-hidden cascade (fallback, K=1 baseline for Qwen 3.5
           and any pre-Fix-3 inject)**. The Qwen 3.5 MTP head has its
           own KVCache that advances across chain calls, so cascading
           on target's hidden with the MTP cache doing the position
           refinement still produces distinct drafts; kept as-is for
           Qwen 3.5 which does not implement ``return_hidden`` on the
           MTP path yet.

        Args:
            hidden_last: [B, 1, H] backbone hidden state at the last
                confirmed position (main_tok's position).
            main_tok: the last confirmed backbone token (drives d_1).
            prev: rolling ``prev_tokens`` tensor for logits_processors,
                or None.
            K: chain length. MUST be >= 1; caller is responsible for
                skipping when the controller parked at K=0.
            cache_commit: optional first-call cache-commit tuple
                (see ``_step_mtp``). Only applied on the FIRST call in
                the chain — subsequent chain calls carry ``None``.
